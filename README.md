## Description:
A Python-based simulation exploring the emergence of voting blocs through allelomimetic behavior. This model demonstrates how local copying mechanisms lead to the formation of stable voting communities on a 2D lattice, with particular relevance to Philippine voting patterns. Features temporal evolution visualization from t=0 to t=50000, showing the transition from random distribution to organized voting blocs.


## Key Features:
- 50x50 lattice simulation
- Allelomimetic (neighbor-copying) mechanism
- Temporal evolution visualization
- High-resolution snapshots
- Moore neighborhood implementation
